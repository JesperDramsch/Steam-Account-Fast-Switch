Steam-Account-Fast-Switch
=========================

Switch to a different steam account quickly.

I got tired of manually logging out of my steam account everytime I wanted someone else to have a go on my machine. So I started a quick account switcher, and *of course* it got out of hand.

## Initial set up
The initial setup tries to look up Steam automatically. If it fails, you will have to give some directions directly.
### Steam Location

### Account Management
You will be asked to add your Steam Login, you can just start with one and add any later on.

## Normal use
Your password will be secured (within limits of the powershell) it will NOT be saved at any point during this program. The program works entirely local, so no communication with a sever occurs.

After the initial set up, the first screen will look like this. You can choose the appropriate account and just go on.

If you want to add more accounts, it's easy as 1,2,3... X
